## What is this?

**OneNote Exporter** is a simple Windows desktop app that helps you **escape the OneNote ecosystem** by exporting your notebooks, sections, and pages into **PDF files**.

---

## Why does this exist?

Because:
- I got 15GB 💀 of OneNote notebooks on my school microsoft account.
- Eventually, I'm gonna lose access to this account.
- My personal OneDrive account can only store 5 GB on the free tier 💀 (I'm not tryna pay)

This tool lets you:
- Browse all open OneNote notebooks
- Select exactly what you want to export
- Export pages as PDFs in a clean folder structure

Then:
- You can put the exported PDFs into an Obsidian vault or something. idk up to you (at least its not in OneNote anymore)

## What does it export?
```
📂 OneNote Exports
 └── 📂 Notebook Name
      └── 📂 Section Name
           ├── 📄 Page 1.pdf
           ├── 📄 Page 2.pdf
           └── 📄 Page 3.pdf
```
Each notebook becomes a folder.  
Each section becomes a subfolder.  
Each page is exported as a PDF file.

3. Click **Refresh**
4. Select the notebooks / sections / pages you want

6. Hit **Export**
